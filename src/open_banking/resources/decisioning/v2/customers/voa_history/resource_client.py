        Generate a Verification of Assets with Income (VOAI) report for all checking, savings, money market, and investment accounts for the given customer. This service retrieves up to 24 months of transaction history for each account and uses this information to generate the VOAI report. The report includes 1 - 6 months of all debit and credit transactions for asset verification. By default, the history is set to 61 days, however, you can change the transaction history in this section by setting the `fromDate` parameter. The report also includes up to 24 months of income credit transactions (ordered by account and confidence level) regardless of `fromDate` for income verification.

        This is a premium service. The billable event is the successful generation of a VOAI report.

        Before calling this API, a consumer must be created for the given customer ID (see Consumers APIs).

        If no account of type checking, savings, money market, or investment is found, the service will return HTTP 400 Bad Request.
